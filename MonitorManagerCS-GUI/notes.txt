Completely overhauling this program now.

Remove unwanted VCP codes:
	Duplicates
	Codes with a current value of 0 and a maximum value of 0
	Reset codes

Menu bar for restarting service, reloading display information
	Maybe a dev-only menu bar with extra non-user-friendly options?

Save and Apply restarts service or triggers it to update.

Improvements:
Are you sure you want to exit? message

Start in system tray setting. - default on

Minimize to tray setting. - default on

Settings tab accessible through a button (cog icon), menu item, or right click context menu rather 
than a tab. Then hide the tab bar because its ugly.

Zoom in on chart for accurate placement

Adjust snapping

Checkbox to show only automated VCP codes for each display

Copy VCP automation points and paste onto another VCP chart

Allow VCP codes to be 'linked' so that they are set in parallel and have the same values.

Make the application look good.

Major Improvements:
Replace ControlMyMonitor by creating a independent DDC/CI interface
