Completely overhauling this program now.

Make ControlMyMonitor part of the application by making it part of the App's resources.
	This makes it so that you can just install this app without having to install ControlMyMonitor 
	and without telling the program where ControlMyMonitor is installed.

Improvements:
Are you sure you want to exit? message
Start in system tray setting. - default on
Minimize to tray setting. - default on
Zoom in on chart for accurate placement
Adjust snapping
Checkbox to show only automated VCP codes for each display
Copy VCP automation points and paste onto another VCP chart
Allow VCP codes to be 'linked' so that they are set in parallel and have the same values.
