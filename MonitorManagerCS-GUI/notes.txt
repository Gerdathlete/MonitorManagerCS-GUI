Completely overhauling this program now.

You can now do everything you would want in the UI basically.
The next step is to save the settings you made for each VCP code.
	Save & Apply button?

Then, we need to run a service that controls the monitors
	Update values periodically (global setting for update period)
	Interpolate between points to find desired value
	Set the VCP code to the value with ControlMyMonitor

Make ControlMyMonitor part of the application by making it part of the App's resources.
	This makes it so that you can just install this app without having to install ControlMyMonitor and without telling the program where ControlMyMonitor is installed.
