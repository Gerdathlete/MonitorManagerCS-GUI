Completely overhauling this program now.

Add a way to identify which monitor is where.

Make ControlMyMonitor part of the application by making it part of the App's resources.
	This makes it so that you can just install this app without having to install ControlMyMonitor 
	and without telling the program where ControlMyMonitor is installed.

Improvements:
Zoom in on chart for accurate placement
Adjust snapping
Copy VCP automation points and paste onto another VCP chart
Allow VCP codes to be 'linked' so that they are set in parallel and have the same values.
